# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Here, you’ll find all my cool work throughout the course. I’m passionate about data, and I believe that data-driven stories can make an impact. You should probably hire me if you're looking for someone who loves to combine data with creativity!

# About me
Hi! I'm Pratyush Jain, a student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a degree in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I have a passion for turning raw data into compelling visuals that communicate clear stories.

I'm particularly interested in AI, machine learning, and how we can leverage big data to solve real-world problems. Outside of academics, I enjoy working on personal coding projects and diving into the latest advancements in AI. I’m excited to showcase my journey through this course here on my portfolio!

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I’m hoping to learn how to effectively communicate data insights through clear and engaging visualizations. Specifically, I want to improve my ability to:
1. Critique data visualizations constructively and learn what makes a visualization effective.
2. Apply different visualization techniques and tools to represent data in compelling ways.
3. Develop visual storytelling skills that are essential for business presentations and research papers.

After graduation, I hope to work as a data scientist or machine learning engineer, ideally focusing on building AI solutions for industries like finance. In addition, I want to continue honing my skills in data visualization because it plays a crucial role in communicating AI and data-driven insights to a wider audience.
